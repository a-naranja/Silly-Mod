#SHIPS,,,,,,
silly_cargo,SHIP,"A hapazardly welded together fighter comprised of a standarized cargo container and some spare weapons. Surprisingly durable, it can serve as makeshift cover for allies.",,,,
,,,,,,
silly_burden,SHIP,"An unusual ship very similar to the Afflictor, the Burden trades more reactor power for heavier armour plating.",,,,
silly_mudskipper7,SHIP,"A series of ill-advised modifications have been made to the already questionable Mudskipper Mk.II to turn the large ballistic hardpoint into a turret. The amazing success of this conversion is often times eclipsed by the humble combat capacity of the base hull. 

Most commonly used as interplanetary ferry, the Mudskipper is indeed interstellar-capable. The ship has no built-in shield generator so must rely on its durable - for a civilian craft - armor to protect passengers and cargo. There is little hope for the Mudskipper in combat, but it is generally equipped with a rear-facing turret to foil attacks by the ever-popular Salamander missile.",,,,
silly_ap,SHIP,"A mediocre attempt at hacking an Apogee blueprint is the reason the Ap exists. Severely incomplete compared to the cruiser, the Ap has been made into a missile boat to still perform against the sector more traditional frigates. Some of the original exploration equipment remains, aiding cartographing efforts.",,,,
silly_gremmk1,SHIP,"""Yes, it matches our data. Yes, including the electromechanical automation and armor appliques. No, our team is gathering more information, we should have a clear lead for the next report.""",- SEALED HOLO REPORT to be submitted to the Director of Special Acquisitions ONLY,,,
silly_gremmk1ModuleL,SHIP,"A medium piece of applique armor that fits neatly around the Grem-Mk.I, greatly improving it's survival capabilities.",,,,
silly_gremmk1ModuleR,SHIP,"A medium piece of applique armor that fits neatly around the Grem-Mk.I, greatly improving it's survival capabilities.",,,,
,,,,,,
silly_falalaf,SHIP,"Falalaf hulls are born from salvaged Eagles welded together. While the turrets might not have the best angles, the cruiser features multiple forward hardpoints.",,,,
silly_shortquest,SHIP,"After thinking long and hard about ways to improve the Conquest, Doohickey engineers decided to cut short the capital and install a smaller but more efficient shield projector. The result is a promising cruiser hull, able to install heavy weaponry whilst mantaining great mobility. For some reason, pirates have been known to mock Shortquest captains.",,,,
silly_eagle,SHIP,"Doohickey Corp's own variant of the eagle features an experimental integration of medium-sized Thermal Pulse Cannons and a flexible mount variety. Silly Particles have been used to enhance the performance of auxiliary engines and allow the ship to fire the medium TPCs without need for a massive reactor. A very priced, rare, and dangerous cruiser.",,,,
,,,,,,
silly_atlas,SHIP,"The solution for cheap and easy to produce capital carrier hulls, the Silly Atlas could appear to be a pirate creation instead of a corporate venture. Despite its looks (and performance), this ""carrier"" has managed to find place inside poor indipendent and mercenary fleets. Some bar-certified engineers say that the Doohickey Corporation has been bribing Hegemony inspectors and decorating the safety reports about the Silly Atlas but thus far those rumours remain unproven.",,,,
silly_zigguratmk1,SHIP,"""No, no I will not. I'm telling you, this is ship should not exist and it's clearly cursed, we have lost half a dozen men and two of them looked like their corpse had been dried. We are provoking forces way beyond our understanding. Contact the rest of the team, we are leaving, we shouldn't have set foot inside that machine from hell.""",- Salvor's team chief verbal report,,,
silly_ziggModTL,SHIP,"A massive piece of applique armor. Analysis reveals presence of domain, post-collapse, and silly particles applied technology. The pieces do not feel cold at touch and both engineers and scientists advice against manipulation.",,,,
silly_ziggModTR,SHIP,"A massive piece of applique armor. Analysis reveals presence of domain, post-collapse, and silly particles applied technology. The pieces do not feel cold at touch and both engineers and scientists advice against manipulation.",,,,
silly_ziggModBL,SHIP,"A massive piece of applique armor. Analysis reveals presence of domain, post-collapse, and silly particles applied technology. The pieces do not feel cold at touch and both engineers and scientists advice against manipulation.",,,,
silly_ziggModBR,SHIP,"A massive piece of applique armor. Analysis reveals presence of domain, post-collapse, and silly particles applied technology. The pieces do not feel cold at touch and both engineers and scientists advice against manipulation.",,,,
,,,,,,
silly_station,SHIP,"A silly-model orbital station featuring a heavy broadside and rapid axial rotation. This platform hosts shipyards, habitats, factories, and large stockpiles of weapons and supplies allowing projection of military and industrial power throughout the local orbital volume.",,,,
module_silly_broadside,SHIP,"A very heavy station defense broadside module, this component alone demonstrates firepower comparable to any two standard line battleships. The combined mounting station segment - including this and counterweight defense and armor modules - is generally operated at a higher than usual rate of rotation to permit rapid on-target/recovery cycle.",,,,
module_silly_support,SHIP,"A fighter support station module designed to enhance a station's local volume power-projection by mounting multiple fighter bays and missile launch points. This is a relatively soft target which nonetheless includes respectable point defense and armored hangars. A munitions depot, specialized on-site forges, and an isolated combat power system are situated on the inward-face.",,,,

#WEAPONS,,,,,,
sillyrepeater,WEAPON,"""If someone asks, you have not seen or heard about any special weapon development. This deal is better than you no longer being seen or heard; surely you are smart enough to know what to do.""","- Audio log, [REDACTED]",,,
,,,,,,
sploinkBeam,WEAPON,"An exotic weapon that successfully makes use of Silly Particles. The core influences the stress-energy tensor to manipulate gravitons and force them to follow a tracer laser beam. Anything caught inside experiences denormalization and loses momentum, making this an excellent disruptive weapon that deflects missiles and stops small ships on their tracks.",,,,
sillyMedTPC,WEAPON,"A post-collapse production that mixes old Domain TPC technology and Silly Particles. Just like its bigger counterpart, the Silly Medium TPC is integrated inside the hull but the addition of new technology allows the  smaller cruiser reactor to power both guns without too much strain on the flux grid.",,,,
,,,,,,
#SHIP SYSTEMS,,,,,,
silly_mote_control,SHIP_SYSTEM,Energy motes deal heavy EMP damage to ships and obliterate fighters and missiles. Using the system creates a temporary attractor point for the motes. The motes automatically target nearby missiles and fighters unless an attractor point is set on an enemy ship.,,,,
,,,,,,
#ITEMS,,,,,,
silly_particles,RESOURCE,"Exotic particles used in experimental applications. Some superstitious workers don't like working nor handling them and claim the containers are a ""bad luck charm"".",,,,
silly_refined_particles,RESOURCE,"Refined Silly Particles condensed and contained inside an adecuate receptacle. These are used in highly experimental contraptions, shipwrighting, military materiel and some extravagant medical procedures.",,,,
,,,,,,
#PLANETS,,,,,,
lemat_description,CUSTOM,Lemat is the home and main operative base of Doohickey Corporation. An overgrown jungle and exotic gases are the main enemy of colonization efforts.,Lemat,"Lemat, choking with vegetation, stands before you.",,
,,,,,,
#FACTIONS,,,,,,
doohickeyCorp,FACTION,"Doohickey Corporation, often just Doohickey Corp., was once the project of an independent entrepreneur group to research new technology after the collapse and produce new, functional hulls and weapons with the now less opresive Domain regulations. After the first AI War, however, tight regulations were imposed by the Hegemony and this new persean corporation could not manage to lift off, much less rival the ever-present Tri-Tachyon. Knowing that Doohickey Corp. could not afford to take part in the already saturated field of AI development and high-power generators, the board has taken interest in producing more ""affordable"" and ""interesting"" spacecraft and military-grade weaponry that is often sold to independent and Hegemony contractors alike.",,,,
