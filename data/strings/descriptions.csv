#SHIPS,,,,,,
silly_cargo,SHIP,"A hapazardly welded together fighter comprised of a standarized cargo container and some spare weapons. Surprisingly durable, it can serve as makeshift cover for allies.",,,,
,,,,,,
silly_burden,SHIP,"An unusual ship very similar to the Afflictor, the Burden trades more reactor power for heavier armour plating.",,,,
silly_mudskipper7,SHIP,"A series of ill-advised modifications have been made to the already questionable Mudskipper Mk.II to turn the large ballistic hardpoint into a turret. The amazing success of this conversion is often times eclipsed by the humble combat capacity of the base hull. 

Most commonly used as interplanetary ferry, the Mudskipper is indeed interstellar-capable. The ship has no built-in shield generator so must rely on its durable - for a civilian craft - armor to protect passengers and cargo. There is little hope for the Mudskipper in combat, but it is generally equipped with a rear-facing turret to foil attacks by the ever-popular Salamander missile.",,,,
silly_ap,SHIP,"A mediocre attempt at hacking an Apogee blueprint is the reason the Ap exists. Severely incomplete compared to the cruiser, the Ap has been made into a missile boat to still perform against the sector more traditional frigates. Some of the original exploration equipment remains, aiding cartographing efforts.",,,,
silly_gremmk1,SHIP,"""Yes, it matches our data. Yes, including the electromechanical automation and armor appliques. No, our team is gathering more information, we should have a clear lead for the next report.""",- SEALED HOLO REPORT to be submitted to the Director of Special Acquisitions ONLY,,,
silly_gremmk1ModuleL,SHIP,"A medium piece of applique armor that fits neatly around the Grem-Mk.I, greatly improving it's survival capabilities.",,,,
silly_gremmk1ModuleR,SHIP,"A medium piece of applique armor that fits neatly around the Grem-Mk.I, greatly improving it's survival capabilities.",,,,
silly_hound,SHIP,"One of the first Doohickey creations, this amalgamation of hulls provides thrice the firepower at barely increased cost. A few independent and many pirates have found in the Hell Hound a new (unreliable) way to punch over their strenght.",,,,
,,,,,,
silly_skong,SHIP,"The Skong destroyer is one of the few hegemony commisions grated to Doohickey Corp. Initially just a downsized version of the reliable eagle, a late demand from hegemony officials forced the corporation to add an integrated Silly Medium TPC when the design was already at a very late stage, making the ""creativity"" of doohickey engineers shine. While it is generally accepted that the sideways integration is extremely underwhelming, the Hegemony was forced to accept the design begrudginlgy after many months of lawyer-backed negotiations.",,,,
silly_nitro,SHIP,"More of a hazard than a ship, the Nitro is a fast frontline destroyer with heavy focus on speed. In fact, speed might be the only strong point of the Nitro. Some say it fills the role of a fast scout, blockade runner or pirate bait, but no one is really sure.",,,,
silly_jumper,SHIP,"One of the few Silly Elite hulls sold to the wide public, the Jumper is a fast destroyer with heavy custom weaponry modifications. Employing Silly Particles and unusual armaments, this ship is beloved by aggressive pilots and loathed by admirals.",,,,
,,,,,,
silly_falalaf,SHIP,"Falalaf hulls are born from salvaged Eagles welded together. While the turrets might not have the best angles, the cruiser features multiple forward hardpoints.",,,,
silly_shortquest,SHIP,"After thinking long and hard about ways to improve the Conquest, Doohickey engineers decided to cut short the capital and install a smaller but more efficient shield projector. The result is a promising cruiser hull, able to install heavy weaponry whilst mantaining great mobility. For some reason, pirates have been known to mock Shortquest captains.",,,,
silly_eagle,SHIP,"Doohickey Corp's own variant of the eagle features an experimental integration of medium-sized Thermal Pulse Cannons and a flexible mount variety. Silly Particles have been used to enhance the performance of auxiliary engines and allow the ship to fire the medium TPCs without need for a massive reactor. A very priced, rare, and dangerous cruiser.",,,,
silly_arrow,SHIP,"One of the most feared Elite Doohickey cruisers, the Arrow is a fast and dangerous ship. Included on each ship comes the built-in Arrow Missiles ship system that fires multiple fast tracking energized munitions from the wings of the craft.",,,,
silly_thingamajing,SHIP,"Exotic particles used i-//ERROR:SHIP-TYPE AS RESOURCE-TYPE

Please register your Tri-Tachyon datapad to receive the latest news and updates.",,,,
,,,,,,
silly_atlas,SHIP,"The solution for cheap and easy to produce capital carrier hulls, the Silly Atlas could appear to be a pirate creation instead of a corporate venture. Despite its looks (and performance), this ""carrier"" has managed to find place inside poor indipendent and mercenary fleets. Some bar-certified engineers say that the Doohickey Corporation has been bribing Hegemony inspectors and decorating the safety reports about the Silly Atlas but thus far those rumours remain unproven.",,,,
silly_zigguratmk1,SHIP,"""No, no I will not. I'm telling you, this is ship should not exist and it's clearly cursed, we have lost half a dozen men and two of them looked like their corpse had been dried. We are provoking forces way beyond our understanding. Contact the rest of the team, we are leaving, we shouldn't have set foot inside that machine from hell.""",- Salvor's team chief verbal report,,,
silly_ziggModTL,SHIP,"A massive piece of applique armor. Analysis reveals presence of domain, post-collapse, and silly particles applied technology. The pieces do not feel cold at touch and both engineers and scientists advice against manipulation.",,,,
silly_ziggModTR,SHIP,"A massive piece of applique armor. Analysis reveals presence of domain, post-collapse, and silly particles applied technology. The pieces do not feel cold at touch and both engineers and scientists advice against manipulation.",,,,
silly_ziggModBL,SHIP,"A massive piece of applique armor. Analysis reveals presence of domain, post-collapse, and silly particles applied technology. The pieces do not feel cold at touch and both engineers and scientists advice against manipulation.",,,,
silly_ziggModBR,SHIP,"A massive piece of applique armor. Analysis reveals presence of domain, post-collapse, and silly particles applied technology. The pieces do not feel cold at touch and both engineers and scientists advice against manipulation.",,,,
,,,,,,
silly_station,SHIP,"A silly-model orbital station featuring a heavy broadside and rapid axial rotation. This platform hosts shipyards, habitats, factories, and large stockpiles of weapons and supplies allowing projection of military and industrial power throughout the local orbital volume.",,,,
bigMod,SHIP,"A very heavy station defense broadside module, this component alone demonstrates firepower comparable to any two standard line battleships. The combined mounting station segment - including this and counterweight defense and armor modules - is generally operated at a higher than usual rate of rotation to permit rapid on-target/recovery cycle.",,,,
diagMod,SHIP,"One of the new inventions from Doohickey Corp. including phase coils. This station module makes use of Silly Particles to bind faster p-space matter to a normal space body. Surprisingly, the casualties are mostly related to enemy combatants and the experiment was deemed a success.",,,,

#WEAPONS,,,,,,
sillyrepeater,WEAPON,"""If someone asks, you have not seen or heard about any special weapon development. This deal is better than you no longer being seen or heard; surely you are smart enough to know what to do.""","- Audio log, [REDACTED]",,,
,,,,,,
sploinkBeam,WEAPON,"An exotic weapon that successfully makes use of Silly Particles. The core influences the stress-energy tensor to manipulate gravitons and force them to follow a tracer laser beam. Anything caught inside experiences denormalization and loses momentum, making this an excellent disruptive weapon that deflects missiles and stops small ships on their tracks.",,,,
sillyMedTPC,WEAPON,"A post-collapse production that mixes old Domain TPC technology and Silly Particles. Just like its bigger counterpart, the Silly Medium TPC is integrated inside the hull but the addition of new technology allows the  smaller cruiser reactor to power both guns without too much strain on the flux grid.",,,,
sillyFlak,WEAPON,"An alteration of the regular Flak Cannon, the Silly Flak makes use of low grade Silly Particles encased on a regular flak ammunition. The result is a weapon almost identical to the regular Flak but easier to install.",,,,
,,,,,,
#SHIP SYSTEMS,,,,,,
silly_mote_control,SHIP_SYSTEM,Energy motes deal heavy EMP damage to ships and obliterate fighters and missiles. Using the system creates a temporary attractor point for the motes. The motes automatically target nearby missiles and fighters unless an attractor point is set on an enemy ship.,,,,
sillyArrowMissiles,SHIP_SYSTEM,Integrated missile launchers on both sides of the Arrow shoot their Silly Particle-energized munitions on system use. Tracking capabilities ensure contact with enemy combatants at unprecedent rate.,,,,
sillyTemp,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Increases timeflow twofold. Using Silly Refined Particles increases the area affected, facilitating use on big hullsizes but the performance is worse than the usual Temporal Shell.",,,,
,,,,,,
#ITEMS,,,,,,
silly_particles,RESOURCE,"Exotic particles used in experimental applications. Some superstitious folk don't like working nor handling them and claim the containers are a ""bad luck charm"".",,,,
silly_refined_particles,RESOURCE,"Refined Silly Particles condensed and contained inside an adecuate receptacle. These are used in highly experimental contraptions, shipwrighting, military materiel and some extravagant medical procedures.",,,,
,,,,,,
#PLANETS,,,,,,
lemat_description,CUSTOM,Lemat is the home and main operative base of Doohickey Corporation. An overgrown jungle and Silly Particles presence are the main enemy of colonization efforts.,Lemat,"Lemat, choking with vegetation, stands before your fleet. Spacefaring visitors can observe the various gray fumes from the corporation's heavy industry mixing with the planet's pinkish particles that flutter around the atmosphere. On the northen hemisphere, various human-made buildings break the monotonous green shades of Lemat's jungles - a testament to mankind's tenacity and adaptation, even in uncertain times.",,

#FACTIONS,,,,,,
doohickeyCorp,FACTION,"Doohickey Corporation, often just Doohickey Corp., was once the project of an independent entrepreneur group to research new technology after the collapse and produce new, functional hulls and weapons with the now less opresive Domain regulations. After the first AI War, however, tight regulations were imposed by the Hegemony and this new persean corporation could not manage to lift off, much less rival the ever-present Tri-Tachyon. Knowing that Doohickey Corp. could not afford to take part in the already saturated field of AI development and high-power generators, the board has taken interest in producing more ""affordable"" and ""interesting"" spacecraft and military-grade weaponry that is often sold to independent and Hegemony contractors alike.",,,,
doohickeyElite,FACTION,"Doohickey Corporations most private branch. Many experimental designs are tested (or guarded) by well paid and trained members of the Doohickey Elite Department. This department is on the forefront of Silly Particles research and has produced multiple viable creations with remarkable performance.

There has been reports of nationalistic sentiment upon the ranks of this more military-focused branch but the corporation has made clear that those are just baseless rumours, and any declarations against the Hegemony surely come from inebriated, off-duty workers.",,,,
